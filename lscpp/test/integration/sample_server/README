Emulates communication with the sample_server by sending pre-recorded messages.
Currently, I don't intend to extend this type of testing. If regression tests of similar kind are needed,
they should probably be implemented on the vscode extensions if possible.
The test relies on the language server to respond in the same order (as is currently implemented).
To record a communication you can enable the comm_logger of stdio_transporter which logs one message per file.
Simple `cat` all the `.in` messages (in correct order) to get the input for the test.
