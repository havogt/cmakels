Emulates communication with the sample_server by sending pre-recorded messages.
The test relies on the language server to respond in the same order (as is currently implemented).
To record a communication you can enable the comm_logger of stdio_transporter which logs one message per file.
Simple `cat` all the `.in` messages (in correct order) to get the input for the test.
